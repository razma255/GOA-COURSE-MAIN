            In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of Myra were subjugated <br> by the newly arrived Muslim  Seljuq dynasty, and soon after their Greek <br> Orthodox church had been declared  to be  in schism by the Catholic church <br>  (1054 AD), a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed the <br> major  bones of Nicholas's  skeleton from his  sarcophagus in the Greek <br> church in Myra. Over the objection of the   monks of Myra the sailors <br>took the  bones of St.  Nicholas to Bari, where they are now enshrined in the <br> Basilica di San  Nicola. Sailors from Bari  collected  just half of Nicholas' <br> skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the church  sarcophagus.
